### Introduction

Humans are barely able to remember a phone number of one of their contacts and will have to put a considerable amount of work in to remember it, let alone all the contact details about that singular person. Now think about how much time and effort that would need to be put in to remember every single detail about every single contact they have. That seems like an unnecessary chore and our software is the solution to that.

### Problems that this software will solve

Forgetting a number / remembering an incorrect number – Phone numbers and emails consist of a long string of numbers / letters and all it takes is one incorrect character to make the information pointless. Thanks to the software storing all this data, the user will not need to remember any of the data and will have easy access to it whenever they need it.

### Benefits that this software will bring to the user

Remembering new details / changing a person’s details – People’s contact details are changing all the time, new phone numbers and new email addresses, so having to memorise these new changes may be time consuming. By allowing the user to alter these contact details within the app, they save themselves lots of time as it is a simple change within the app.
Additionally, the search feature that the software will contain will be extremely beneficial to users with a large number of contacts. The user will have the ability to search this list via name, phone number and email address, whilst sorting all the contacts to display them alphabetically. This feature will aid in users trying to locate the specific contact detail that they were looking for.

### Impacts that the software will have on the customer’s business

Due to the applications target audience being everyone as a result of its use case, it will bring in a huge number of users. These users will then see previous products of DFCorp such as the Secret Diary, and be more inclined to look into and potentially buy it.
This is caused firstly by showing the other products off to people who may not have been initially interested in them. This can almost be seen as potential upselling of the other products DFCorp has to offer bringing in more users.
Brand loyalty is also common with users. Knowing that DFCorp products are reliable may make users want to stick with the same DFCorp products as opposed to other market competitors. This will keep users with the company and means they will not look for other options.
